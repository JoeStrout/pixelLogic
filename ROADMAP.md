## Exercises

- Drawing Lines: connect inputs directly to outputs.  Light up a smiley face.
- Crossing Lines: learn the crossing trick; connect inputs to outputs in a different order.  
- Not Gate: draw the Not gate in all four orientations.
- Binary Display: light up a 0 or 1 based on the input level.
- Double Not: chain two Not gates to make a logic diode.
- Or: combine traces (protected by double-nots) to implement an OR gate.
- AND gate: make an AND gate from three Not gates.
- Greater than 5: take a 3-digit binary input, and determine whether it represents a value bigger than 5.
- Binary Decoder: connect 3 input lines to 8 output lines in such a way that the correct output lights up for each binary input.
- 7-Segment Display: take a 4-digit binary input, and light up a 7-segment display to show the right digit 0-F.
- XOR gate: make an XOR gate.
