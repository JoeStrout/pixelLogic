## Exercises

- Drawing Lines: connect inputs directly to outputs.  Light up a smiley face.
- Crossing Lines: learn the crossing trick; connect inputs to outputs in a different order.  
- Not Gate: draw the Not gate in all four orientations.
- Binary Display: light up a 0 or 1 based on the input level.
- Double Not: chain two Not gates to make a logic diode.
- Or: combine traces (protected by double-nots) to implement an OR gate.
- AND gate: make an AND gate from three Not gates.
- Alarm circuit: turn on the output (alarm) if the Armed input is high, and the Motion Sensor or the Window Sensor is high.
- Binary Comparator: given two input bits A and B, light up the appropriate of three outputs: A < B, A = B, or A > B.
- Greater than 5: take a 3-digit binary input, and determine whether it represents a value bigger than 5.
- Binary Decoder: connect 3 input lines to 8 output lines in such a way that the correct output lights up for each binary input.
- Prime Number Detector: 3-digit binary input; light up the output for prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7).
- 7-Segment Display: take a 4-digit binary input, and light up a 7-segment display to show the right digit 0-F.
- XOR gate: make an XOR gate.
- Half Adder: add two bits, resulting in a 2-digit output (or Sum and Carry outputs).  Solution uses the XOR gate.
- Full Adder: add three bits, producing a 2-digit output.  Solution uses Half Adder.
- 2-to-1 Multiplexer: uses a Select input to choose which other input (A or B) is routed to the output (Z).
