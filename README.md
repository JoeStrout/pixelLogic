# Pixel Logic Circuit Simulator

This is a circuit simulator sandbox/game based on [this design](https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/).


Pixel Logic Circuit Simulator is written in [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org]), and currently runs in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/), though eventually it may be ported to [Soda](https://github.com/JoeStrout/soda).
